## Features

**Instant results** — Select both conductors and your part number appears immediately, no button to press.

**Colour-coded display** — The screen changes colour to match the wedge (Yellow, Blue, Red, White) so you can double-check at a glance.

**Works offline** — Once installed, the app works without any mobile data or Wi-Fi. Perfect for areas with no coverage.

**Smart search** — Start typing any part of the conductor name and the list filters as you go. You don't need to know the exact name.

**Sort options** — In Settings you can sort the conductor list by name, size, or material — whatever works best for how you search.

**Hide unused conductors** — If there are conductors you never work with, you can hide them in Settings to keep your list clean and fast.

**Show or hide diameters** — Toggle conductor sizes on or off in the search list, depending on your preference.

**Saves your preferences** — Your settings are remembered between sessions so you only have to set them up once.

## Tips for Field Use

- You don't need to type the full conductor name — a few letters is usually enough to find it
- The result screen is designed to be readable in bright sunlight
- If you lose mobile signal, the app keeps working normally
- If the app ever seems out of date, close it fully and reopen — it will update automatically when you're back on Wi-Fi
